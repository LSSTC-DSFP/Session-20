The final part will help you build intuition for why aliasing occurs and what impact it has on your ability to characterize signals of interest. "

After you plot the signal, plot the FFT of the signal using the np.fft.fft function. When you plot, make sure you understand the structure and symmetries of the object FFT returns. We will discuss why this object behaves this way in Session 21 - it is related to deep facts about the Fourier transform and its discretization for running on digital processors. "

    "Using the Wiener filter in practice requires you to have an estimate of the signal and noise spectra (and their sum) in advance. While this is theoretically problematic, in practice it's rarely an issue. We can proceed in two ways. A more sophisticated method is to define a signal and noise function with a functional form close to those expected in your simulated signal from part a. Then compute the filter and filter the total signal to recover the component of interest. Alternatively, it is often easier to just approximate the signal PSD as the total PSD of the observed signal and assume the noise is flat in frequency space. Try both. Some code for achieving this is outlined below."
