## Day 5 — Professional Development, Hack Session, and Session Wrap Up 

"Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again."

~ Jean Luc Picard, *Star Trek: Generations*
