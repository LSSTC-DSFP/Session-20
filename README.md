## Day 3 — Lomb Scargle 

"People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but *actually* from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint - it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff."

~ The Tenth Doctor, *Doctor Who*

"Outside the ship, the thin membrane of space-time rippled with the gravitational waves, like a placid lake surface disturbed by a night breeze."

~ Liu Cixin, *The Three Body Problem*
