# Linear Regression Tutorial for Astronomers

*Christina Hedges, March 2024*

This tutorial covers some of the key concepts for astronomy graduate students to get an easy understanding of how to build linear models for their time-series data. This is the material as of March 2024. The source of these materials is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/christinahedges/linearModelTutorial/) and is where these materials may be updated and improved. You can see a live version of these slides [here](https://christinahedges.github.io/LinearModelTutorial/#/).

Inside the `workbooks` folder there are two workbooks where you can fill in the code and it will check your answers. Answers are available in the `workbooks/answers/` folder if you need them.

Inside `workbooks` is also a notebook that goes through the 2D example from the slides. The intention is this will be our live coding portion of the tutorial!
